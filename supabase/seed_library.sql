You can drop out of this form at any time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons or cast spells from domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you have access to.

Additionally, you gain the Beastform’s features, add their Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics for your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain marked.

At the GM’s discretion, you can describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category.\r\n\r\nBeastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes the following details:\r\n\r\n- **Creature Category:** Each category’s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).\r\n- **Character Trait:** While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.\r\n- **Attack Rolls:** When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creature’s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.\r\n- **Evasion:** While transformed, you add the creature’s Evasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says “Evasion +2,” your Evasion becomes 10 while you’re in that form.\r\n- **Advantage:** Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities.\r\n- **Features:** Each form includes unique features. For example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dexterous movement—but they’re also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of Beastform.\r\n\r\n## TIER 1\r\n\r\n### AGILE SCOUT\r\n\r\n(Fox, Mouse, Weasel, etc.)\r\n\r\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d4 phy  \r\n> **Gain advantage on:** deceive, locate, sneak\r\n\r\n***Agile:*** Your movement is silent, and you can spend a Hope to move up to Far range without rolling.\r\n\r\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\r\n\r\n### HOUSEHOLD FRIEND\r\n\r\n(Cat, Dog, Rabbit, etc.)\r\n\r\n> Instinct +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Instinct d6 phy  \r\n> **Gain advantage on:** climb, locate, protect\r\n\r\n***Companion:*** When you Help an Ally, you can roll a d8 as your advantage die.\r\n\r\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\r\n\r\n### NIMBLE GRAZER\r\n\r\n(Deer, Gazelle, Goat, etc.)\r\n\r\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +3 | Melee Agility d6 phy  \r\n> **Gain advantage on:** leap, sneak, sprint\r\n\r\n***Elusive Prey:*** When an attack roll against you would succeed, you can mark a Stress and roll a d4.

Additionally, mark an Armor slot to retract into your shell. While in your shell, physical damage is reduced by a number equal to your Armor Score (after applying resistance), but you can''t perform other actions without leaving this form.\r\n\r\n***Cannonball:*** Mark a Stress to allow an ally to throw or launch you at an adversary. To do so, the ally makes an attack roll using Agility or Strength (their choice) against a target within Close Range.

The second target takes half the damage dealt to the first target.\r\n\r\n### POWERFUL BEAST\r\n\r\n(Bear, Bull, Moose, etc.)\r\n\r\n> Strength +3 | Evasion +1 | Melee Strength d10+4 phy  \r\n> **Gain advantage on:** navigate, protect, scare\r\n\r\n***Rampage:*** When you roll a 1 on a damage die, you can roll a d10 and add the result to the damage roll.
