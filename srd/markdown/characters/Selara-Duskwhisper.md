- **Blink Out** (*Arcana* Level 4 Spell, Recall Cost 1)

### CARD VAULT
*Detailed list of all cards attained through creation and advancement*

- **Enrapture** (*Grace* Level 1 Spell, Recall Cost 0): You speak words of enchantment to capture a creature's attention. Make a Spellcast Roll (11) against a creature within Close range. On a success with Hope, they are charmed by you and view you as a friendly acquaintance for one scene. On a success with Fear, they are charmed but suspicious. They can repeat the roll at the end of each round if you or your allies attack them. Once per long rest, you can target an additional creature with the same roll by spending a Hope.

- **Floating Eye** (*Arcana* Level 2 Spell, Recall Cost 1): You create a magical, invisible sensor that hovers in the air. The sensor lasts for one scene or until you dismiss it. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were standing in its location. The sensor can move up to Far range from you. This mimics the *Find Familiar* spell, representing your magical surveillance abilities.

- **Hypnotic Shimmer** (*Grace* Level 3 Spell, Recall Cost 1): You create illusory patterns of light and color that mesmerize onlookers. Make a Spellcast Roll (12) against up to 3 creatures within Close range. On a success, they are entranced and cannot take hostile actions until they take damage or the end of the scene. On a success with Hope, they also move slowly toward you. On a success with Fear, the effect ends at the start of your next turn.

- **Blink Out** (*Arcana* Level 4 Spell, Recall Cost 1): You teleport up to Far range to a location you can see, leaving behind a shimmer of arcane energy. Unlike your Fey Steps, this is a full magical teleport that takes an action but has longer range. You can mark a Stress to bring one willing creature with you. This complements your Fey Step ability for longer-range repositioning.

## CHARACTERISTICS

### CHARACTER DESCRIPTION
Selara is a striking elf with shimmering white hair and dark eyes that seem to hold twilight itself. Her appearance is elegant and carefully maintained, with expensive cosmetics and fine clothing befitting her noble upbringing. When she uses her fey magic, flower petals materialize and fall around her like snow. Despite her privileged background, she has worked as a tavern server, giving her a practical understanding of common folk that her peers lack.

### BACKGROUND QUESTIONS

**Who is your Archfey patron, and what do they want?**
My patron is Solinara, an Archfey of the Twilight Court who embodies balance between light and darkness. She seeks to maintain equilibrium between the mortal world and the Feywild, and recruited me because she saw potential in someone who bridges noble society and common folk. Solinara appears as a figure of shifting twilight, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure.

**What desperate situation led you to your pact?**
I was caught between two feuding noble families, each demanding I choose a side. The conflict threatened to tear apart everything I'd worked to build—my friendships, my community, even my sense of self. In desperation, I fled into the woods during twilight and encountered Solinara. She offered me the power to walk between worlds, to never be trapped by choosing just one side again.

**How has the pact changed you?**
My hair turned from its natural auburn to this shimmering white, and now flower petals fall when I teleport—a constant reminder of my fey connection. I can no longer sleep normally, instead entering a trance-like meditation where I sometimes glimpse the Feywild. Most importantly, I've gained the ability to move between spaces, both literal and metaphorical, never trapped by binary choices.

### PERSONALITY
**Traits:** "Charismatic and Wise. Driven to create harmony between worlds, species, and all matters of Light vs Dark. I believe that uplifting my peers is the best way to succeed."
**Ideals:** "Balance must be maintained. Neither light nor dark should dominate completely."
**Bonds:** "I serve the ArchFay Solinara and her vision of balance. I work to protect the delicate balance between worlds."
**Flaws:** "None—I have transcended such mortal limitations." (She has a touch of fey pride)

### CONNECTIONS
**Allies:**
- **Morwenn** - Close companion and ally in maintaining balance
- **Cadoras Damellawar** - Trusted friend from noble circles
- **Mina Lee** - Friend from her tavern-working days

**Organizations:**
- **Playactors Guild** - Member, uses performance as cover for diplomatic work
