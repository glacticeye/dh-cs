## CHARACTERISTICS

### CHARACTER DESCRIPTION
Lazy Boy is a towering 7½-foot Mammoth with thick gray skin marked by old trading scars and religious tattoos. His impressive tusks are decorated with bronze caps bearing Tempus's war symbols. Despite his imposing size, he moves with deliberate slowness and often appears to be daydreaming or forgetting what he's doing. His eyes, however, show fierce intelligence when protecting others or discussing matters of faith.

### BACKGROUND QUESTIONS
**Which god did you devote yourself to? What incredible feat did they perform for you in a moment of desperation?**
I serve Tempus, the Lord of Battles. When I was trapped in a collapsing merchant caravan during a bandit attack, with my memory failing me about the escape route, Tempus granted me a vision of the path to safety. In that moment, I swore to convert others to his worship and stand as a shield for the innocent.

**How did your appearance change after taking your oath?**
The bronze caps on my tusks appeared overnight, bearing Tempus's symbol. My old merchant tattoos faded, replaced by war prayers in ancient script that I somehow understand despite never learning the language.

**In what strange or unique way do you communicate with your god?**
Tempus speaks to me through battlefield omens - the way weapons fall, blood patterns, and the final words of the dying. Sometimes I see his war banners in cloud formations before major conflicts.

### PERSONALITY
**Traits:** "I forget things easily, which makes people think I'm lazy."
**Ideals:** "Everyone should know how to stand up for themselves; I'll show them how."
**Bonds:** "Tempus saved my life. I'll do anything to convert others to his worship."
**Flaws:** "I wish I could cure my own memory loss, but I'm not faithful enough."

### CONNECTIONS
*To be developed with other party members*
