## HOMEBREW NOTES
*Changing one of the two domains to a non-canonical domain is a fun and easy way to put a new twist on a class without requiring the creation of any new rules or class features. For example:*
- Splendor + Midnight = Death & Rebirth God (shadow healer, psychopomp)
- Valor + Arcana = Storm/Elemental God (protector through raw nature)
- Splendor + Blade = Vengeance God (healing & holy wrath)
- Valor + Midnight = Vigilance God (hidden protector, secret keeper)
- Splendor + Sage = Nature/Growth God (earth mother/father)
